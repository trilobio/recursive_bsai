# Validation

Sequences were manually validated with https://goldengate.neb.com/#!/

Assembly JSON is saved here. The control linkers were used for simulation, since their software isn't advanced enough for methylation. They also did not have support for annealing primers together into duplexes (unlike snapgene), so I just manually added BsaI sites to the end.
